# Cryptography . 
Knowledge about the cryptography and the network security and also the usage of the different algoriths for the implementation of the project the word cryptography 
defines it self as a process of encryption and decryption which plays a major for the security.

Cryptography is associated with the process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa. It is a method of storing and transmitting data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. Cryptography not only protects data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.

# Modern cryptography concerns with:

Confidentiality - Information cannot be understood by anyone

Integrity - Information cannot be altered.

Non-repudiation - Sender cannot deny his/her intentions in the transmission of the information at a later stage

Authentication - Sender and receiver can confirm each.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

* All the sectors it is important like bank, mncs etc.

## What:

* To save their data.

## When:

* For the important data communication.

## Where:

*Any time when the communication or saving the data is used
